I'll generate a comprehensive markdown project catalog for the Tokopedia Microservices Clone project, categorizing the services and architectural patterns:

## Tokopedia Microservices Clone - Project Catalog

### Core Services Architecture

| Service | Pattern | Description | Key Benefits |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| [Product Service](/services/product-service.md) | Domain-Driven Design | Product catalog and inventory management | Modular product data handling, scalable catalog |
| [Order Service](/services/order-service.md) | Event-Driven Architecture | Order processing and tracking | Decoupled order workflows, real-time status updates |
| [User Management](/services/user-management.md) | Identity and Access Management | User authentication and profile management | Secure user interactions, centralized access control |
| [Cart Service](/services/cart-service.md) | State Management | Shopping cart operations | Efficient temporary data storage, dynamic pricing |
| [Payment Service](/services/payment-service.md) | Transaction Management | Payment processing and refunds | Secure transaction handling, multi-method support |

### Supporting Services Architecture

| Service | Pattern | Description | Key Benefits |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| [Notification Service](/services/notification-service.md) | Pub/Sub Pattern | Communication and alerts | Multi-channel messaging, event-driven updates |
| [Search Service](/services/search-service.md) | Query Optimization | Product search and recommendations | Advanced filtering, personalized discovery |
| [Shipping Service](/services/shipping-service.md) | Adapter Pattern | Logistics and delivery management | Multi-carrier integration, flexible shipping logic |
| [Review Service](/services/review-service.md) | Aggregation Pattern | Product feedback collection | Comprehensive rating system, user-generated content |

### Infrastructure Services Architecture

| Service | Pattern | Description | Key Benefits |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| [Supplier Management](/services/supplier-management.md) | Facade Pattern | Supplier and inventory coordination | Centralized supplier interactions, inventory tracking |
| [API Gateway](/services/api-gateway.md) | Gateway Aggregation | Service communication orchestration | Unified interface, request routing |
| [OAuth2 Server](/services/oauth-server.md) | Authorization Framework | Authentication and access management | Secure token-based authentication |

### Cross-Cutting Architectural Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Implementation Focus |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| [Microservices](/patterns/microservices.md) | Distributed system architecture | Independent service deployment |
| [Event Sourcing](/patterns/event-sourcing.md) | State changes through event logs | Comprehensive system audit trail |
| [Circuit Breaker](/patterns/circuit-breaker.md) | Fault tolerance mechanism | Resilient service communication |
| [Saga Pattern](/patterns/saga-pattern.md) | Distributed transaction management | Consistent data across services |

### Prototyping and Development Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Key Features |
|------|---------|--------------|
| [Protobuf Template](/tools/protobuf-template.md) | Service contract definition | Efficient data serialization |
| [Common Utilities](/tools/common-utilities.md) | Shared development resources | Consistent implementation patterns |

### Integration Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| [Anti-Corruption Layer](/patterns/anti-corruption-layer.md) | System boundary protection | Isolating service interactions |
| [Backend for Frontend](/patterns/backend-for-frontend.md) | Client-specific backend services | Optimized client experiences |
| [Strangler Fig](/patterns/strangler-fig.md) | Incremental system modernization | Gradual legacy system replacement |

### Deployment Architectural Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Deployment Benefits |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| [Sidecar](/patterns/sidecar.md) | Auxiliary service deployment | Enhanced modularity |
| [Ambassador](/patterns/ambassador.md) | External service communication proxy | Improved network resilience |
| [Strangler](/patterns/strangler.md) | Incremental system migration | Risk-managed refactoring |

## Architectural Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each service operates as an independent unit
2. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capabilities
3. **Resilience**: Fault-tolerant system design
4. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging
5. **Security**: Multi-layer security implementation

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Communication**: gRPC, Protocol Buffers
- **Architecture**: Microservices
- **Design Methodology**: Domain-Driven Design

## Contribution Guidelines

- Explore individual service repositories
- Review architectural documentation
- Follow established design patterns
- Maintain service independence
- Prioritize clean, modular code

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific section or architectural pattern in this catalog?
