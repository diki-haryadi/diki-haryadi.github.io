# Anti Patterns Catalog
## Software Design Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Description | Key Drawbacks |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| [God Object](#god-object) | Class that does everything | Violates Single Responsibility Principle |
| [Poltergeists](#poltergeists) | Classes with limited responsibilities | Short lifecycles, unclear purpose |
| [Boat Anchor](#boat-anchor) | Retaining unused system parts | Maintenance burden, complexity |
| [Golden Hammer](#golden-hammer) | Overreliance on familiar solutions | Suboptimal problem-solving |
| [Lava Flow](#lava-flow) | Retaining undesirable code | Technical debt accumulation |

## Object-Oriented Programming Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Description | Key Drawbacks |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| [Circular Dependency](#circular-dependency) | Mutually dependent classes | Tight coupling, maintainability issues |
| [Constant Interface](#constant-interface) | Interfaces that define constants | Improper use of interfaces |
| [Yo-Yo Problem](#yo-yo-problem) | Excessively fragmented structure | Reduced code comprehension |

## Project Management Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Description | Key Drawbacks |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| [Analysis Paralysis](#analysis-paralysis) | Overthinking without action | Delays, missed opportunities |
| [Death March](#death-march) | Overcompressed project parameters | Burnout, failure risk |
| [Scope Creep](#scope-creep) | Uncontrolled scope changes | Budget/schedule overruns |
| [Mushroom Management](#mushroom-management) | Keeping developers uninformed | Disengagement, poor decisions |

## Organizational Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Description | Key Drawbacks |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| [Blame Storming](#blame-storming) | Finger-pointing instead of problem-solving | Unresolved issues, team conflict |
| [Moral Hazard](#moral-hazard) | Insulating decision-makers from consequences | Misaligned incentives, poor outcomes |
| [Stovepipe or Silos](#stovepipe-or-silos) | Isolated groups within organization | Inefficiency, duplicated effort |

## Methodological Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Description | Key Drawbacks |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| [Copy-and-Paste Programming](#copy-and-paste-programming) | Duplicating code across program | Maintainability issues, bugs |
| [Coding by Exception](#coding-by-exception) | Adding code for special cases | Complexity, maintainability issues |
| [Reinventing the Wheel](#reinventing-the-wheel) | Creating custom solutions unnecessarily | Wasted effort, missed benefits |
| [Premature Optimization](#premature-optimization) | Optimizing without proven need | Overengineering, wasted resources |

## Software Architecture Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Description | Key Drawbacks |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| [Stovepipe System](#stovepipe-system) | Poorly integrated components | Limited interoperability, agility |
| [Vendor Lock-In](#vendor-lock-in) | Overreliance on proprietary tech | Reduced flexibility, cost |
| [Design by Committee](#design-by-committee) | Consensus-based design choices | Suboptimal expertise-driven decisions |
